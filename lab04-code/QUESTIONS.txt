PROBLEM 1: Memory Diagram
=========================

  Examine the code in dog_diagram.c which uses a couple simple functions
  with a struct.
  ,----
  |  1  #include <stdio.h>
  |  2  typedef struct{
  |  3    int age;
  |  4    double weight;
  |  5    char name[8];
  |  6  } dog_t;
  |  7  
  |  8  void init_dog(dog_t *d){
  |  9    strcpy(d->name, "Rolf");
  | 10    d->age = 0;
  | 11    d->weight = 5.0;
  | 12    ////// POSITION A
  | 13    return;
  | 14  }
  | 15  
  | 16  void birthday(int num, dog_t *d){
  | 17    int next = d->age + num;
  | 18    if(next < 3){
  | 19      d->weight += 10.0;
  | 20    }
  | 21    ////// POSITION B
  | 22    d->age = next;
  | 23    return;
  | 24  }
  | 25  
  | 26  int main(){
  | 27    dog_t dog;
  | 28    init_dog(&dog);
  | 29    double curwgt = dog.weight;
  | 30    birthday(2, &dog);
  | 31    printf("%s gained %f pounds\n",
  | 32           dog.name, dog.weight-curwgt);
  | 33    return 0;
  | 34  }

PROBLEM 2: Valgrind Debugging badmem.c
======================================

  The file badmem.c has functions main() and set_pn() in it but has a
  bad memory problem associated with it.  A sample compile and run is as
  follows.

  ,----
  | > gcc -g badmem.c
  | > a.out
  | Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  `----

  Below is some output from Valgrind. Explain the errors that are
  identified by Valgrind and inspect the source code of badmem.c to
  discover the source of the error. Clearly identify whether there is a
  problem in main() or set_pn().

  Fix badmem.c so that it works correctly. Your fix should NOT change
  the prototype for the set_pn() function but can make other adjustments
  to local variables.


PROBLEM 3: Best Score in File
=============================

  A grading file has scores for an exam formatted as in the following
  example:
  ,----
  | Darlene 91.0
  | Angela  76.5
  | Elliot  94.5
  | Tyrell  87.5
  | Dom     70.0
  | Phillip 55.5
  `----
  The names of students are the first item followed by a numeric score
  on their programming exam.  Write `main()' function in the file
  `best_score.c' which
  - Opens the file
  - Reads through all the contents
  - Prints out the name and score of the highest scorer

  Make use of the following small struct in this exercise to ease the
  process of copying information as indicated.
  ,----
  | typedef struct {
  |   char name[128];               // name of student
  |   double score;                 // score on exam
  | } grade_t;
  | // struct which allows assignment of name/score such as in
  | //   best = curgrade;
  | //   printf("best is now: %s %f\n", best.name, best.score);
  `----
  - Don't forget to close the file
  - Study the session below for special cases such as empty files

  ,----
  | > gcc -g best_score.c
  | > ./a.out 
  | usage: ./a.out <filename>
  | <filename> should have columns of names, numbers as in
  | Darlene 91.0
  | Angela  76.5
  | Elliot  94.5
  | Tyrell  87.5
  | Dom     70.0
  | Phillip 55.5
  | > ./a.out scores1.txt
  | Best score: Elliot 94.500000
  | > ./a.out scores2.txt 
  | Best score: Student13 90.800000
  | > ./a.out scores3.txt 
  | Best score: Student43 99.300000
  | > ./a.out scores-empty.txt
  | file was empty
  | > ./a.out no-such-file.txt
  | could not open the file
